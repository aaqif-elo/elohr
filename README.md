## Prerequisites

### Development Environment (Windows)

- **Node.js v22** (LTS)
- **pnpm v10.10** - Specific version required for package management
- **MongoDB** - Database connection
- **Discord Bot Token** - For Discord integration
- **Required environment variables** (see `.env.example`)

### Production Environment (Ubuntu/Linux)

- **Ubuntu/Linux server** - The deployment script is designed for Ubuntu
- **PM2** - For process management in production
- **Chrome/Chromium browser** - Required for Puppeteer (image generation)

The following system packages are automatically installed by the deployment script:

- `gconf-service`, `libgbm-dev`, `libasound2` - For Puppeteer browser automation
- `chromium-browser` - Browser engine for report generation
- Various graphics and system libraries for headless browser operation

## Development

> **Note**: The development environment is currently set up for Windows.

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:2500`

### Additional Development Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm run generate

# Build for production (Windows)
pnpm run build
```

## Building & Deployment

### Building (Windows)

Build the production version on your Windows development machine:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This creates a `elohr.zip` file containing the built application.

### Production Deployment (Ubuntu)

> **Note**: Deployment is designed for Ubuntu/Linux servers.

The deployment process involves:

1. **Build on Windows**: Run `pnpm run build` to generate `elohr.zip`
2. **Transfer files**: Copy the following files to your Ubuntu server:
   - `elohr.zip` (generated build)
   - `deploy.sh` (deployment script)
   - `.env` (production environment variables)
3. **Deploy**: Run the deployment script on the server:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

The deployment script automatically handles:
- Stopping the previous PM2 process
- Removing old files
- Extracting the new build
- Installing Node.js v22 and pnpm v10.10 if needed
- Installing system dependencies for Puppeteer
- Installing Chrome/Chromium browser
- Installing npm dependencies
- Starting the application with PM2

### Environment Setup

1. **Development (.env for Windows)**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Configure for development environment
   ```

2. **Production (.env for Ubuntu)**
   - Configure production values
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV='production'`
   - Set correct `FRONTEND_URL`
   - Configure production database connection
