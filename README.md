## 🛠️ Development

> **Note**: The development environment is currently set up for Windows.

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:2500`

### Additional Development Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm run generate

# Build for production (Windows)
pnpm run build
```

## 🏗️ Building & Deployment

### 💻 Building (Windows)

Build the production version on your Windows development machine:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> [!TIP]
> This creates a `elohr.zip` file containing the built application ready for deployment.

### 🐧 Production Deployment (Ubuntu)

> [!WARNING]
> Deployment is designed for Ubuntu/Linux servers only.

The deployment process involves:

1. **🔨 Build on Windows**: Run `pnpm run build` to generate `elohr.zip`
2. **📤 Transfer files**: Copy the following files to your Ubuntu server:
   - `elohr.zip` (generated build)
   - `deploy.sh` (deployment script)
   - `.env` (production environment variables)
3. **🚀 Deploy**: Run the deployment script on the server:

   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> The deployment script automatically handles:

> - Stopping the previous PM2 process
> - Removing old files
> - Extracting the new build
> - Installing Node.js v22 and pnpm v10.10 if needed
> - Installing system dependencies for Puppeteer
> - Installing Chrome/Chromium browser
> - Installing npm dependencies
> - Starting the application with PM2
